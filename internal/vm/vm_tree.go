// The tree tier.
//
// The interpreter's loop pays for every instruction it dispatches: an
// indirect jump the processor mostly mispredicts, and the state of the loop
// stored and loaded around it. A function whose code the tier can build is
// run instead as trees of Go closures, one tree for each expression, each
// node computing its value from its children's and returning it: no operand
// stack, and a node for every few instructions rather than a dispatch for
// each.
//
// The trees are built from the function's bytecode, not its source, so that
// what an instruction does is decided in one place. Within a basic block the
// operand stack is followed symbolically: what an instruction pushes is a
// tree, and what consumes it takes the tree as a child. Children are
// evaluated in the order their instructions ran. Anything still on the stack
// where that order could otherwise change -- at the end of a block, before a
// statement, before a call -- is evaluated into the frame's own stack slot
// for it, where the interpreter would have had it, and read back from there.
//
// A node does what the instruction does: the interpreter's fast path where it
// has one, and otherwise the same helper it calls. A node that can throw or
// run code sets the frame's pc to its instruction first, so that a stack
// trace, and anything else that asks where the frame is, sees what it would
// have. An exception is a Go panic of a treeThrow, caught where the function
// began; nothing in the tier's functions catches one, so it leaves the
// function, as an exception with no handler in it does.
//
// A function with an instruction the tier does not build -- an exception
// handler, an iterator, a generator's, anything rarer than a loop's -- runs
// in the interpreter as before.
