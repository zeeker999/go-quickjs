// The register interpreter (docs/register-interpreter.md), stage 1: a
// function the register form covers runs as its register code, every other
// as before. QJS_REG in the environment turns it on.
//
// A frame's registers are a window of the runtime's value stack laid out as
// the stack form's frame is -- the locals, then the temporaries -- so that a
// closure captures a local, a stack trace reads a pc and the frame is pushed
// and popped as ever. The loop indexes the window with 16-bit register
// numbers through a pointer to an array of 65,536 values, which needs no
// bounds check: the register backend's verifier (regcomp.Verify)
// proves every register an instruction names is below the frame's count,
// and a frame is given that many slots before it runs. The code is read the
// same way, every jump proven to land in it.
//
// The files sort after every other of the package's, so that the functions
// they add come after every function there was: the interpreter's hot
// functions keep their addresses, and only the closures move.
