// Package lsra is a linear-scan register allocator over an abstract
// machine function: blocks of instructions that use and define virtual
// registers of classes, with fixed clobbers, calls and phis. It knows
// nothing of the source language or the target's instructions: a client
// describes its function, and lowers it with the locations the allocator
// gives.
//
// A virtual register's lifetime is a list of ranges, its holes left out,
// from liveness: the paths from each use back to the definition where
// every register is defined once (SSA), else sweeps of the blocks. A phi
// and its arguments are coalesced -- given one location, their edge's move
// gone -- where their lifetimes do not meet, the edges of the deepest
// loops first; the coalesced registers are a web, which has one register
// or a spill slot. Webs are allocated by a linear scan in order of their
// starts, as Wimmer and Mössenböck's allocator scans with active and
// inactive intervals, so that a web may take a register in another's
// hole. Where a class's registers run out, the web scanned takes the
// register whose webs in its way are least dense -- their uses' weight,
// eight times each loop around them, over the positions they cover --
// and each of those is split: it gives the register up over a hole in its
// life, where it lives in its slot, where each one's holes would cost less
// than its uses and all the new holes less than spilling the web scanned;
// else, as without splitting, they are spilled whole where they are less
// dense than it, and it is spilled otherwise. With Config.Displace, the
// web scanned takes the register whatever their density, each split where
// its holes would cost less than its uses and spilled whole otherwise. A
// hole covers where the two meet,
// widened toward the split web's uses before and after it to where a
// block of a lower loop depth begins, so that the moves into and out of
// it run least; it costs the web's uses in it and those moves -- a store
// where the web goes in, none for one stored where it is defined, a load
// where it comes out -- each by its loop depth. A split web is in its
// register but over its holes; the client makes the moves where a hole
// begins and ends within a block (Result.Moves) and on the edges that
// cross its bounds (Result.Edge), and learns where each is as a block
// begins (Result.Entry). A function with a critical edge, which would
// have no place for an edge's moves, or one allocated with Config.NoSplit,
// is allocated without splitting: where the registers run out, the web
// scanned displaces those in its way only if they are less dense than it,
// spilling them whole, and is spilled itself otherwise. A web in a
// register that is live across a call (Inst.Call) is kept in a slot too,
// stored where each of its registers is defined and loaded again after
// each call it crosses in its register (Result.Across); a call clobbers
// every register, and a web whose reloads would weigh as much as its uses
// lives in its slot. An instruction's fixed clobbers (Inst.Clobber) keep
// the registers they name from the webs live across it, and its
// temporaries (Inst.Temps) are registers apart from its operands and
// results. Slots are given by a second scan, with holes too, a web with a
// parameter keeping the slot it arrives in, a register wider than a slot
// (Func.Width) taking consecutive ones; a split web not stored where it is
// defined needs its slot over its holes alone.
//
// An Allocator keeps its tables, lists and result for its next
// allocation, so that a client allocating function after function
// allocates little once they have grown to its functions' sizes.
