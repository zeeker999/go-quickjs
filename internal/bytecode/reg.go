// The register form of a function's code: what the register interpreter
// runs (docs/register-interpreter.md).
//
// A frame is a window of registers in the runtime's value stack. The first
// LocalCount are the function's locals, in the slots the stack form gives
// them, so that an upvalue, a stack trace and the debugger find a local
// where they always did; the temporaries the stack form keeps on its operand
// stack follow, one register for each depth that stack reaches, and then the
// few registers the register form adds of its own.
//
// An instruction is one 64-bit word, read as a struct of an operation and
// four operands:
//
//	bits  0- 7  Op  the operation
//	bits  8-15  X   a small operand: an argument count, a comparison, a flag
//	bits 16-31  A   a register, most often the destination
//	bits 32-47  B   a register, an index or a small immediate
//	bits 48-63  C   a register, an index or a small immediate
//
// B and C read together are BC, a 32-bit index or a signed jump offset. A
// register is 16 bits, so a function has up to 65,536 of them without any
// form of its own for more; a function that needs more registers runs in the
// stack form until the far moves of the design's later stage exist.
