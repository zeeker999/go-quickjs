# A register interpreter

This is the design of the interpreter that is to replace the stack
interpreter (`executeAt`) and, where it measures faster, the tree tier: a
register machine in the manner of V8's Ignition and of Lua's VM, written in
Go, compiled straight from the AST by a backend of its own. It says what
the instruction set is and why, how the compiler allocates registers, how
the loop is written under Go's constraints, how frames, calls, exceptions,
generators, closures and inline caches work, what becomes of the tree tier
and the JIT, and the stages the migration goes through, each shippable and
measured, the old pipeline the fallback for whatever the new one does not
cover yet.

It starts from what was measured, because two earlier attempts at register
forms went badly and the reasons decide most of what follows.

## The measure

The interpreter's core operations run about twice as slow as a pure-Go
register interpreter we compared against: calls (`call_fib` 2.09x,
`call_mutual` 2.38x), a loop of local moves (`loop_locals` 1.85x), stores
(`prop_write` 1.75x, `array_write` 1.95x), globals (1.66 to 1.85x) and
callbacks from built-ins (`array_reduce_upvalue` 1.74x). Our runtime --
JSON, BigInt, number formatting, regular expressions, generators -- is far
faster than its, so a core that matches makes the engine faster overall.
The project's measure is the V8 suite's composite without the JIT on this
machine, 1,901 today: at least the comparison engine's, and jitless Node's
2,342. EarleyBoyer, Splay and RayTrace, the call- and allocation-heavy
benchmarks, are where the gap is.

Where our time goes was profiled test by test. The costs the design has to
remove are:

- **Operands not read in place.** In the tree tier `a = b` is two closures,
  a store calling a tree that reads the local: about 47 instructions and two
  indirect calls where a register move is about 25.
- **A Go call per node.** Go has no callee-saved registers, so each node a
  block calls reloads what it had live: about 14 instructions a statement,
  5 of them reloads, and 8 more for the callee's prologue and epilogue.
- **Stores that do more than store.** `prop_write` loads `this` it does not
  use and round-trips a float through memory to test a tag; `array_write`
  makes three Go calls a store and converts a constant key every time.
- **Globals.** Two Go calls, about eight dependent loads and three bounds
  checks a read: eval variables, the script's lexical bindings, the slot's
  attributes.
- **Calls.** Nine Go calls, seven of them indirect, for each JavaScript call
  of `call_mutual`, and about 41 ns of machinery: six barrier-checked
  pointer stores into a heap frame, the arguments copied, seven checks that
  reset what the frame's last user left, six stores into the tree context. A
  pure body runs in a stack evaluator whose `switch` is a quarter of the
  samples.
- **Callbacks from built-ins.** A chain five calls deep from `reduce` to the
  callback's tree, a `defer` and `recover` for each call, two interrupt
  ticks.

The profiling agent estimated that fixing the tree tier's nodes would bring
a simple node to about 2.4 ns, against the comparison engine's 1.5 ns a
register instruction. That is the bar this design has to clear, not a reason
to stop: the format has to beat what better nodes would give.

## What the experiments showed

**Fewer dispatches is not the measure.** On 2026-09-29 register forms were
added to the stack interpreter: one generic `bin_r` operation whose operands
were each a local or a stack slot, chosen by their sign. It removed 35% of
the dispatches in Crypto's `am3` and made Crypto 19% slower. Widening
`bytecode.Instr` for the extra operands cost 3% everywhere by itself. What
an instruction costs is the work it does beyond its operation: decoding
operand kinds, branching on them, the instruction's width, and where the
loop's code lands. An instruction that decides at run time what its operands
are, or which operator it is, has a second dispatch inside it.

**A translation is only as good as the stack form.** The first prototype
(`6ae14dca`) made register code from the stack code, over a symbolic stack
whose temporaries were homed by depth. It works -- the vm package's tests
pass with it but for five that pin tree-tier mechanisms -- and it is kept,
frozen, as a reference. It inherits the stack form's granularity (one stack
operation a step, fusions bolted on), its slot layout, its 16-bit sites and
its generic operators, and it cannot do better than what the stack form
says.

**The kernels, by hand.** The design's instruction set was then written by
hand for `am3`'s inner loop, `call_fib` and `loop_locals`, run in a loop of
its own, and timed against the stack interpreter, the tree tier and the
translation, at two placements of the code (`cff0c8ab`, micro-benchmarks,
best of 5, ns an operation):

| Test | Stack interpreter | Tree tier | Translated | Hand-written | Comparison engine |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `crypto_am3` | 208.6 / 216.1 | 103.8 / 104.7 | 105.6 / 107.0 | 101.6 / 101.6 | 81.6 |
| `loop_locals` | 32.8 / 32.9 | 20.9 / 20.9 | 12.3 / 12.7 | 11.6 / 11.6 | 11.3 |
| `call_fib` | 60.4 / 60.1 | 59.4 / 59.9 | 51.5 / 52.0 | 44.1 / 44.3 | 28.6 |
| `empty_loop` | 14.9 / 14.1 | 5.3 / 5.0 | 5.6 / 5.6 | 5.6 / 5.6 | 5.0 |

`am3` runs 25 register instructions a turn where the stack form runs 34:
twice as fast as the stack interpreter, where `bin_r` was slower than it,
because no instruction decodes anything. It is level with the tree tier,
whose int32 nodes were built for this loop. The comparison engine runs the
same 25 instructions -- its disassembly matches the hand-written code
nearly one for one -- in 81.6 ns: 3.3 ns an instruction against our 4.1.
`loop_locals` is level with it. Calls are the largest gap left, 44 against
29 ns: the frame and the entry, not the instructions, which are the same
nine for each recursive call in both.

**Go 1.27's loop-invariant pass hurts an interpreter.** The NaN that
`Float` canonicalizes to is a constant; the pass took it out of the loop,
once for each of seven uses, into seven XMM registers that every case
calling anything then saved and restored. Reading it from a variable instead
took `loop_locals` from 15.0 to 11.5 ns and `empty_loop` from 6.6 to 5.6.
Any constant the loop's cases use is read from memory or folded into an
instruction for this reason.

## Instructions

### Format

An instruction is one 64-bit word with fixed fields:

```
bits  0- 7  Op  the operation
bits  8-15  X   a small operand: an argument count, a flag
bits 16-31  A   a register, most often the destination
bits 32-47  B   a register, an index, a 16-bit immediate
bits 48-63  C   a register, an index, a 16-bit immediate or jump offset
```

B and C together are BC, a 32-bit index or offset. Every operation decodes
each field it uses with one shift and one zero or sign extension, the same
for every operation: no operand is ever of a kind decided at run time. A
register is 16 bits, so a function has 65,536 registers before anything
special is needed, where an 8-bit design has 256.

A 16-bit register costs nothing an 8-bit one does not: `regs[uint16(w>>16)]`
is a shift and a zero extension, as `regs[uint8(w>>8)]` is, and indexing a
pointer to an array of 65,536 values with a `uint16` needs no bounds check,
as indexing one of 256 with a `uint8` does not. What it costs is width:
eight bytes an instruction where a 32-bit design has four. Our stack
instructions are twelve bytes today. The common case is therefore as fast
as an 8-bit design's, which is what the hand-written `loop_locals` shows,
level with the comparison engine's 8-bit code.

### No limit

Nothing in a function is capped:

- **Registers past 65,535.** A function that needs more has them as far
  registers, reached only by two moves: `mov_far A, BC` copies far register
  BC (32 bits) to register A, and `mov_to_far BC, A` the other way. The
  allocator gives near registers to parameters, temporaries and the bindings
  used most, and far ones to the rest; an operation on a far binding is a
  move in, the operation, a move out. A function of that size is generated
  code, run once.
- **Sites, constants and names past 65,535.** An operation whose index would
  not fit has a wide form: the same operation followed by an extension word
  holding a 32-bit index, read by the wide form's case alone, so the narrow
  form's case never tests for it. Global reads, loads of constants and
  closures already take a 32-bit BC and need none.
- **Jumps past 32,767 instructions.** A compare-and-branch's offset is 16
  bits; one that would not fit is the opposite branch over a `jmp`, whose
  offset is 32 bits.
- **Calls of more than 255 arguments.** The count is X; a call of more is
  its wide form, with the count in the extension word.

Ignition does this differently: 8-bit operands by default, and the `Wide`
and `ExtraWide` prefixes that make the next instruction's operands 16 or 32
bits. V8 generates each handler three times, once per operand scale, and
dispatches the prefix as an instruction of its own. In Go the prefix is a
second dispatch, and three copies of each case would triple the loop past
the size at which Go stops inlining into it (below). Ignition saves bytes,
which V8 counts carefully; at eight bytes an instruction we spend some, and
in exchange the 16-bit case is the common one and the far forms are rare
and separate.

### No accumulator

Ignition keeps one operand of most operations in an accumulator, which
makes its bytecode small: `Add r1` adds r1 to the accumulator. In V8 the
accumulator is a machine register the generated handlers keep across the
dispatch. In Go it would be a `Value`, two machine words, carried around a
loop in which every case that calls anything clobbers every register: Go
has no callee-saved registers, and its allocator spills a value live across
the loop at its definition. The kernels show what that costs: the loop's pc
and instruction word, which have to be live across the dispatch, are
already stored to the stack at every instruction. An accumulator would add
two stores and two loads to every instruction, and two or three dispatches
to every expression -- `l = xl * l` is `Ldar xl; Mul l; Star l` where three
address code has one `mul`. At 3 to 4 ns a dispatch in Go, against about
1 ns in V8's handlers, the dispatch count dominates. The set is three
address: an operation reads its operands from registers or immediates and
writes its result to a register.

### The operations

Each hot operation is an opcode of its own, as Ignition's `AddSmi`,
`BitwiseOrSmi` and `ShiftRightSmi` are, so that no hot case switches on an
operator held in the instruction. A generic form that names its operator is
kept only for cold operators (`**`, `in`, `instanceof`, `typeof` beyond its
fused tests). The families:

- **Moves and loads:** `mov`, `load_int` (a 32-bit immediate), `load_const`,
  `load_undef`, `load_null`, `load_true`, `load_false`, `load_empty`,
  `load_hole`.
- **Arithmetic:** `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `mod` of two registers;
  `add_imm`, `sub_imm`, `mul_imm` with a 16-bit immediate; `inc`, `dec`,
  `neg`, `to_numeric`. Each has a number fast path in its case and calls out
  for anything else.
- **Bitwise:** `bit_and`, `bit_or`, `bit_xor`, `shl`, `shr`, `ushr`, and
  each with an immediate, and `bit_not`, with an int32 fast path; the
  immediate forms are what Crypto's masks and shifts are.
- **Comparisons that branch:** `jlt`, `jle`, `jgt`, `jge` and their
  negations `jnlt`, `jnle`, `jngt`, `jnge` -- different from each other where
  a NaN is compared -- with a register or an immediate on the right, and
  `jseq`, `jsne`, `jeq`, `jne`, `jnullish`, `jundef`, `jtypeof` (a typeof
  compared with a literal): a comparison that decides a jump never makes a
  boolean.
- **Comparisons that produce a value:** `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`, `seq`,
  `sne`, `eq`, `ne`, cold enough to share one generic case.
- **Jumps:** `jmp`, `jtrue`, `jfalse` (ToBoolean, a boolean's without a
  call). A jump with a negative offset counts the interrupt budget.
- **Bindings:** `get_upval`, `set_upval`, `check_hole` (the dead zone's
  ReferenceError, naming the binding), `close_upvals`.
- **Globals:** `get_global` and `set_global` carry their site, whose entry
  remembers the slot; a strict store is its own operation.
- **Properties and elements:** `get_prop`, `set_prop`, `get_method` (which
  writes the method and the receiver into a call's window in one
  instruction), `get_index`, `set_index`, `get_index_imm`, `set_index_imm`
  (an immediate index: `tab[3] = j` with no load of the 3), `get_length`,
  `define_field`, `new_object` (from the literal's site and its first
  values, as one instruction), `new_array`.
- **Calls:** `call`, `call_undef_this`, `new`, `ret`, `ret_undef`,
  `call_spread`, `apply_args`, `tail_call`, `closure`.
- **Iteration, exceptions, generators** in later stages: `for_in_next`,
  `iter_next`, `throw`, `rethrow`, `yield`, `await`, `resume`.

The opcode is masked to the switch's size and every value of the mask has a
case, so the jump table needs no range check: today 7 bits, with the unused
values padded, growing to 8 bits when the set passes 128.

### Instructions a turn

What the core tests execute in the inner loop, in the stack form today, in
this set, and in the comparison engine's code (from its disassembler):

| Test | Stack form | This set | Comparison engine |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `empty_loop` | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| `loop_locals` | 9 | 6 | 6 |
| `call_fib` (loop) | 12 | 7 | 7 |
| `call_fib_rec` (recursive / base) | 11 / 6 | 9 / 2 | 9 / 2 |
| `call_mutual` (each call) | 8 | 6 | 6 |
| `prop_write` (4 stores) | 12 | 6 | 6 |
| `array_write` (10 stores) | 44 | 12 | 12 |
| `global_read` (4 reads) | 20 | 10 | 10 |
| `global_write` (4 writes) | 12 | 6 | 6 |
| `method_call` (loop) | 10 | 6 | 7 |
| `array_reduce_upvalue` (callback) | 6 | 5 | 5 |
| Crypto `am3` | 34 | 25 | 25 |

The counts are the same as the comparison engine's but where `get_method`
saves its move into the call window, and where immediates save a load of a
constant it keeps in a register. The difference between the engines is not
the count: it is what each instruction and each call costs.

## The compiler

### A backend of its own

The register code is compiled from the AST by a backend beside the stack
compiler, as V8's `BytecodeGenerator` compiles its AST. It shares with the
stack compiler what is not code generation: parsing, early errors, and
scope resolution -- which name is a binding of this function, an upvalue
and of which descriptor, a global; which bindings a closure captures; what
a direct eval or a debugger can see. The stack compiler records its
resolution of each identifier and declaration as it compiles a function,
and the register backend reads that record instead of resolving names
again, so the two forms of a function agree on every binding by
construction.

The backend runs when the stack compiler finishes a function, while its AST
is at hand, and only where the register tier is on. A function holding
anything the backend does not cover yet is left without register code and
runs as it does today.

### The frame

A frame is a window of the runtime's value stack:

```
r0            the function being called
r1            this
r2 ...        the parameters, in order
              the function's bindings that live in registers
              the temporaries
```

The function and its `this` are registers because a call's window is the
callee's frame: the caller writes the callee to the window's first
register, the receiver to the second and the arguments after them, and the
callee's registers start there. Nothing is copied. A parameter no argument
was given for is made undefined by the call; arguments past the parameters,
which only `arguments` and a rest parameter read, are moved aside first by
the functions that have them.

Bindings take registers in the order the backend meets them. A binding a
closure captures is a register too: the closure's upvalue points into the
window while the frame lives and is closed when it returns, as now, which
works because the value stack never moves. The debugger and stack traces
find a binding through a table of the function's that maps each name to its
register and the range of pcs it is in scope for.

### Register allocation

Temporaries are allocated in scopes, as V8's `RegisterAllocationScope`
does: an expression's operands take registers above those live when it
began, and its scope frees them when it ends, so temporaries are a stack
and the frame's size is the deepest it gets. A call allocates its window
last, at the top of what is live, so that the callee's frame, which starts
at the window and runs past it, overlaps only registers the caller has
finished with.

Code generation is destination-driven: an expression is compiled into the
register its consumer names -- `s = s + x` is one `add` into `s`'s
register, `return a + b` one `add` and a `ret` -- or, where the consumer
only reads it, into whatever register already holds it, which for a binding
is the binding's own. An operand is read where it lies.

Reading a binding in place has one hazard: a call or anything that runs
code between the read and the operation could change it. `x + f()` reads
`x` before `f` runs. The backend copies such an operand to a temporary
first when the rest of the expression could assign it -- an assignment to
the same name in it, or a call where the binding is captured by a closure
that writes it. Everything else is read in place.

### compilediff

`compilediff` compares what the front end makes at two revisions. While the
stack compiler is the source of truth for the stack form, a register backend
change must leave the stack code exactly as it was: compilediff's verdict
of no difference over the test262 tree and the suites is the proof, and the
register code is compared the same way between two revisions of the
backend, by its own listing. Once the stack form is retired, compilediff
compares register code alone.

## The loop

The interpreter is a loop of its own, `runReg`, in files that sort after
the package's other files (`zzreg_*.go`): `executeAt` and the other hot
functions keep their code and their addresses, and the closures move by
the size of what is added, which the placements measure. Its techniques are
the ones Go allows:

- **The register window is unchecked.** The loop holds a pointer to an
  array of 65,536 values at the frame's first register, so `regs[w.A()]`
  has no bounds check. A verifier proves, for every function, that every
  register an instruction names is below the frame's count, and the frame
  is given that many slots before it runs.
- **The code is read unchecked,** at a pc the verifier proves is in the
  code: every jump lands on an instruction, and the last instruction does
  not run on past the end.
- **The switch is a jump table with no range check,** the opcode masked and
  every value of the mask a case: Go makes a jump table only of a switch
  whose cases are dense, and checks its range unless the value is provably
  inside it.
- **Nothing of an instruction is live across a call.** A case that calls out
  keeps the pc in a memory record and reads it, and its instruction, back
  afterwards, so that Go has no reason to save them at every dispatch.
  Slow paths are out of line and re-read their instruction from the code.
- **The loop stays below Go's big-function size.** Go's inliner calls a
  function of 5,000 or more IR nodes big and inlines only callees of cost
  20 or less into it; past that, `regInt32` (cost 41, 18 calls),
  `regTruth`, `Value.IsString`, `propCache.holder` and a dozen more become
  calls in every case. The count is of the loop's own source, before
  anything is inlined into it: a helper inlined costs the loop the few
  nodes of its call, not its body. `TestRegLoopIsNotBig` pins it, as
  `TestIntendedInlining` pins the helpers, and `internal/cmd/bigfunc`
  measures it: `go run ./internal/cmd/bigfunc -func runReg` prints the
  count against 5,000, `-cases 40` each case clause of 40 nodes or more,
  and the callees above cost 20 the loop would call if it were big. The
  budget is spent with care, a hot case at a time:
  - **The compare-and-branches share their taken tail.** A case is a
    fast path and a `goto`: to `slow` (the slow path, `regSlow`),
    `cmpSlow`, `typed`, `jump`, or `taken`, a compare-and-branch taken,
    whose offset `SC` the tail reads. The shared `taken` took 167 nodes out
    of the 29 compare-and-branches' `off = w.SC()` and 49 instructions out
    of the loop.
  - **The slow calls are not shared.** `set_global`, `set_index`'s miss
    and the operations with no fast path each keep their own call of
    `regSlow`. Sent to the one `slow` tail, they saved 45 nodes and made
    `int_arith`, `float_arith`, `loop_sum` and `loop_props` 7 to 11% slower
    at every placement, the inner ones (`regInner`, `regTail`) included,
    with every instruction on those loops' paths the same: the loop's
    blocks laid out otherwise. A tail that stores the pc (`slow`'s
    `kept.pc = pc`) is reached after a call only with the pc read back
    from `kept`: set_index's `goto slow` after `regSetMiss` without it made
    the pc live across the call, Go saved it at every dispatch, and
    `crypto_am3` and a dozen loops were 8 to 11% slower at every
    placement. `TestRegDispatchKeepsNoPC` disassembles the loop and fails
    if its dispatch stores to the stack.
  - **A case costs what its source says.** The compare-and-branches are
    about 53 nodes each, the bitwise operators 73 to 77, a fused element
    read or update 100 to 128, `append` (a call of `regAppend` with the pc
    kept) about 20.
  - **A helper that returns a bool with values does not fold.** A
    `regNums(a, b) (x, y float64, ok bool)` in the compares saved 96 nodes
    and added 40 instructions: its `ok` is materialised and tested where
    the written-out `&&` branches. A saving is checked with `hotdiff
    -funcs '(*Runtime).runReg'` against the build before it.
  - At d931057d the loop was at 4,981, 19 below the limit; with the
    shared taken tail and `append` and `str_freeze` as cases of their own
    it is at 4,875, 125 below.
- **No constants in registers.** What Go's loop-invariant pass would take
  out of the loop is read from a variable (above).
- **The loop holds only the hot operations.** Every case added moves the
  code of every case after it, and the placements, which move the loop as
  a whole, cannot vary that: each case is a lottery for unrelated tests.
  An operation that does not run per turn of a hot loop -- a switch's
  table, `typeof` as a value, an empty literal, what sets a frame up --
  is a label of the one case that calls `regCold`, which switches on the
  operation again. Measured: the switch operations as cases of their own
  made `prop_update` 8.9%, `call_fib` 8.7% and six other tests 5 to 7%
  slower at every placement; behind `regCold`, all are level and the
  switches keep their gain.
- **Opcode values are for per-iteration hot steps.** The 7-bit space holds
  128 values, each a case. An operation that runs per turn of a hot loop
  takes a direct value of its own, out of the free list (`runReg`'s
  `goto invalid` case, which lists them; a value taken out of it and left
  there does not compile). Every other operation -- stage 2's handlers
  and iterator steps but the hot ones, a literal's set-up, a rare
  conversion -- is `cold`, one value, its sub-operation (`RColdOp`) in X,
  dispatched a second time (`regColdSub`). `cold` is a value of the slow
  path's case, whose call of `regSlow` already returns an error: with an
  error check added to `regCold`'s case instead, `empty_loop` was 7.5%
  and `string_build1` 6.4% slower at every placement, and without it
  level (the loop's blocks laid out otherwise, every instruction of those
  loops the same). A value freed goes to the end of the free
  list, and no hot operation is renumbered: its case's code would move.
  At the removal of the translation reference the free values were 24,
  29, 36, 37, 40, 41, 42 and 43, and 127 is `invalid`'s; `iter_next`
  took 24, and `yield`, a loop over a generator's step, 43. Its case
  made Go allocate the loop's registers otherwise (100 instructions
  more, a frame 72 bytes smaller): against the loop before it,
  `typed_u64_read` and `method_moves` were 6 and 8.5% slower at every
  placement of four, and nothing else 3% at all four; with yield sent
  to the slow path's case instead, the loop of the same allocation as
  before, 13 tests were 3.8 to 11.7% slower than with its case at every
  placement -- `array_read`, `global_read`, `int_arith`, `float_arith`,
  `string_length`, `loop_sum`, `loop_locals`, `loop_elements`, the
  generators' -- and the case stays.

What remains is Go's: a register store of a `Value` is a write-barrier
check, the loop's instruction word is still saved at the dispatch where a
case's register pressure needs it, and every case ends in a jump back to
the one indirect branch. A case that would call with the pc live -- a
jump's truthiness or `===` of strings, a throw's `pc-1` -- answers what
needs no call inline and leaves the rest to the compare's slow path, or
passes the loop's pc rather than `pc-1`, which Go would keep from before
the increment: with none left, the dispatch stores no pc. `am3` runs at
3.6 ns an instruction against the comparison engine's 3.3.

## Frames and calls

A call between two register functions is made in the loop's case and a
function it calls, `regEnter`, without the generic call path:

- the callee checked to be a closure of this realm with register code and
  nothing of its surroundings to establish -- not bound, not a class
  constructor called, not an arrow sharing a derived constructor's `this`;
- the window is the callee's frame: its parameters are the arguments;
- the frame record is a few words: the function, the window's base, the pc,
  the caller's record. It lives on the Go stack in `runReg`'s variables,
  and in a table of the runtime's for stack traces, as the comparison
  engine's `frameInfo` is: one pointer store a call where the heap frame
  takes six barrier-checked stores and seven checks;
- the interrupt and depth checks are one decrement and one compare.

The register interpreter recurses on the Go stack, a call of `runReg` for
each JavaScript call, as the stack interpreter does. Running calls inline
in the loop was measured in the stack interpreter and lost 3.7 to 5% (it
spills more); it is not retried until the frame is small enough to change
that answer.

A built-in calling a callback enters the register code directly: the
arguments, which are a Go slice, are copied into a window at the top of
the stack, and `regEnter` runs the callee, with no tree, no `defer` and no
`recover`. A register function calling a built-in passes it the window's
arguments as its slice, without copying.

Stage 1 keeps the heap frame for what reads it today -- stack traces, the
debugger, closures' `this`, errors' positions -- and writes only the fields
those read. Moving every reader to the lean record is stage 2.

## Exceptions

An exception is an error value returned, never a panic: a Go `panic` and
`recover` cost microseconds where a returned error costs a compare. A
function with handlers has a table of them (`RegCode.Handlers`, innermost
first), each a list of ranges of pcs, the handler's pc and the register
the exception's value goes to. Nothing runs as a try block is entered or
left: no push and no pop, as the stack form's `push_catch` and `pop_catch`
are.

- **Every way out of the loop with an error goes through one tail,**
  `fail`, after the switch. A case that can throw stores `kept.pc` before
  it calls out, as every case with a call already did, and on an error
  sets `failed` and jumps to the tail; the tail calls `regCatch`, which
  looks the instruction at `kept.pc-1` up in the table and returns the
  handler's pc, its value written to the handler's register, or -1, and
  the loop returns the error to the caller's case, which does the same.
  `TestRegThrowsKeepPC` reads `runReg`'s source and fails where a `goto
  fail` has no `kept.pc = pc` before it in its case or tail, or where the
  loop returns an error anywhere but from the tail. The tail and the
  stores cost the loop 44 nodes (4,726 to 4,770); the pc is still never
  live across a call. Each case calling `regCatch` itself instead, with
  no tail, cost 177 nodes more (53 below the limit) and was level over
  the placements: nothing 3% or more slower at every placement either
  way, the geometric mean 0.8% faster, `crypto_am3` -4.3% and
  `empty_loop` -5.7% (each slower at one placement of four),
  `global_write` -1.2%. The shared tail stays, for the budget. Against
  s2, before the tail, `global_write` and `global_write_strict` are 4.4%
  slower at every placement with either form: not the tail's.
- **What a handler catches is what the interpreter's catches**
  (`unwindToHandler`): a JavaScript exception (`*Thrown`), whatever threw
  it -- a throw statement, an operator, a getter or a setter, a built-in,
  a call of either tier, a stack overflow's RangeError. An interrupt or a
  memory limit goes on past every handler. A call that threw has left
  the stack and the frame records as they were before it (`popFrameOf`),
  so the handler needs no unwinding of its own.
- **A finally clause is compiled once for each way out of what it
  protects** (regcomp's `try.go`): in place after the block's normal
  completion; before each break, continue or return that leaves it, the
  return's value taken first into a register of its own; and as the
  handler for a throw, which throws the value again at its end. There is
  no completion record and no dispatch on one: each copy goes on as its
  exit does. A copy before an exit is outside the ranges of the handlers
  the exit leaves and inside those of the handlers around them, so that a
  throw from a finally clause run by a break is caught by the try around
  the loop and not by its own catch. Copies nest at most four deep (a
  clause inside a clause is compiled for each copy of the outer); deeper,
  the function stays the stack form's.
- **The catch binding** is its slot's register, which the stack compiler
  records for the clause (`Record.Catches`), or a temporary where nothing
  reads it. A catch clause's pattern, a binding a closure captures in a
  loop (each turn's is a new one) and a using declaration's scope stay
  the stack form's.
- **A throw statement with a handler around it in its function** is a
  move of its value into the handler's register and a jump to it, with
  no `Thrown` made, as the tree's `throwToHandler` does: through the
  table, `try_throw` was 33 to 128 ns (the frames captured for nothing).
- **for-of and for-in loops** keep their cursor in a register of their
  own: `for_of_start` or `for_in_start` makes it (`startForOf`,
  `startForIn`, with their fast paths for an array and a generator) and
  `iter_next` steps it at the head of each turn, jumping out where it has
  no value. The two starts are cold operations; `iter_next` is the one
  direct value stage 2 has taken (24): through `cold`, `regSlow` and
  `regColdSub` were 16% of `generator_for_of`, and as a case (a call
  with the pc kept, 30 nodes) `array_for_of` went from 17.3 to 13.2 ns
  and `generator_for_of` from 93 to 83 in one build. `regIterNext`
  reads an array's element in its dense storage as the tree's
  `iterNextTree` does, and steps a generator's cursor as the tree does
  (`stepGenTree`, resumed in place) under a recover of its own
  (`regIterNextTree`), since a generator's body throws as the tree
  throws, with a panic. Any other iterator's `next`, where it is a
  function of script, is called as register code calls (`regStepNext`,
  through `regCall`): through `iterNext`'s `stepIter` it was called from
  Go, `callObject`, `runFD` and `runTree` making the frame and the
  register function's one tree node entering it, and `iterator_for_of`
  was 257 ns against the tree's 196 (208 so). A Map's or a Set's
  iterator is stepped as the tree's `iterNextTree` steps it
  (`mapIterStep`). A call of a generator function from register code is
  made at its site (`regCallGen`, `regGenCall`: `newGenerator`, the
  receiver coerced as `callClosure` coerces it), not through `regCall`
  and `callDirect`: `generator_create` 480 to 404 ns, the tree 430. The
  step's recover goes when a generator's body is register code (stage
  2, item 3): without it `generator_create` was 383. A key string a for-in handed out is read by
  `get_index`'s slow path as the tree reads it (`stringKeyRead`), and
  `f.call(t, ...)` goes to `callThrough` without the generic call's
  search (`has_own_call_for_in`). A for-of loop's body is in the
  ranges of a handler of its own, the cursor's, which closes the iterator
  as a throw does (`iter_close_throw`, its return method's error dropped)
  and throws again; a break, a continue of an outer loop or a return that
  leaves the loop closes it on the way out as it runs a finally clause
  (`iter_close`, its error thrown), and `iter_next` is outside the
  ranges, so that an iterator whose `next` threw is not closed. A for-in
  cursor needs no closing. A pattern or a member as the target, a
  captured lexical binding (each turn's is a new one) and `for await`
  stay the stack form's.

## Generators and async functions

A generator's frame is its window (regcomp's gen.go, the VM's
zzreg_zgen.go). Suspension copies the window and the pc into the generator
object, and resumption copies them back to the top of the stack and
continues at the pc, as the stack form does with its operand stack -- but
there is no operand stack, so the copy is the frame's registers alone. The
captures open on the window's registers move with it, pointed at the
generator's copy on a suspension and back at the stack on a resumption
(`regMoveUps`), so that two closures made in different resumptions share a
binding. A generator of register code keeps its window in its `vals`,
`numRegs` values and then, where the code keeps them, its arguments; its
`pc` is a register pc, and `generator.reg` marks it.

- **The code's first instruction is `gen_entry`** (cold), which a
  resumption that goes on skips: `runReg` starts at the pc it is given,
  0 for any other frame. `gen_entry` runs at the frame's first run, and
  at a throw injected, which it throws at the suspension, a negated pc
  in the frame's `savedSP`. `yield` is a case of the loop's own
  (`RYield`), the step of a loop over a generator: through `cold`, the
  three switches its suspension and `gen_entry` went through
  (`regSlow`, `regColdSub`, `regColdGen`) were a third of a for-of's
  step.
- **A generator's creation runs its parameters' binding** up to
  `end_params`, which suspends it, as the stack form's prologue does: a
  default or a pattern that throws, throws at the call. An async
  function's are bound by its first resumption, which runs at once
  (`runAsync`), an error there rejecting its promise as the specification
  has it.
- **What a resumption delivers goes to the suspension's own register,**
  never a binding's, written before the code runs (`regGenResume`):
  `yield` (R[A] the value sent in), `await` (what it settled to),
  `yield_star` (the value and how, a pair). A return injected at a yield
  is compiled after it, a return statement there, through the finally
  clauses and the loops' iterators it leaves (`retFrom`); the yield's next
  instruction jumps past it, and a resumption by next starts past that
  jump. A throw injected is thrown at the suspension itself, inside its
  handlers' ranges.
- **`yield*` is a loop of the code's own,** as the stack form's is:
  `iter_resume` sends what the generator was resumed with to the
  delegate's next, throw or return, `iter_unpack_delegate` reads its
  result (an async generator awaits it first), `yield_star` suspends with
  it, and a return the delegation carried out returns from after the
  loop. An operation whose next instruction is a jump (`iter_resume`,
  `iter_unpack_delegate`, `iter_result`, `async_iter_close`) takes it to
  leave and skips it to go on: the verifier checks the jump is there.
  A synchronous yield* to a generator its realm's next steps is stepped
  directly, as the tree's `delegateNext` steps one (`regDelegateNext`):
  what the delegate yields goes on as a value, the frame suspended as at
  the `yield_star` four instructions on (the verifier checks it is
  there), with no result object at any level of a chain of delegations.
  The delegation's steps are placed at the operand's position, as the
  stack form's are.
- **A for await's step** is `async_iter_next`, `await` and `iter_result`
  into a register of its own; the body is in the ranges of the cursor's
  handler, which closes it as AsyncIteratorClose does -- the return
  method's result awaited, what closing throws dropped -- and a break, a
  continue of an outer loop or a return that leaves it closes it the same
  way, the result awaited and checked to be an object.
- **The drivers are the stack form's:** next, return and throw, an async
  function's steps and an async generator's queue call `resumeFull`, and
  `resumeFrame` hands a register generator's resumption to
  `regGenResume`, which answers with the same `resumeResult`; next
  resumes a suspended register generator of its realm at once. A for-of
  over a register generator steps it with no recover (`regGenStep`),
  its body throwing as register code throws: next's frame pushed as
  `stepIter` pushes it, no result object, no search for a tree. A
  generator whose parameters need no code (`end_params` the second
  instruction) is not run at its creation; its first resumption starts
  past `end_params`. A call site of a generator function or an async
  function makes its object without the generic call's search
  (`regGenCall`), an async function's first step at once.
- **An await's job continues in place.** An async function its await's
  job resumes from the job queue (`generator.awaitJob`, a frame of kind
  `regFrameAwaitJob`) goes on in place at an await of a value that is not
  an object or of a fulfilled promise of the realm's own constructor,
  where no job is waiting: the job the await would queue would be the
  queue's next, and the frame would be resumed with that value. The first
  run of an async function, which its caller's code follows, never does.

## Closures and upvalues

A closure captures a binding by pointing an upvalue at its register while
the frame lives; the frame's return closes it, copying the value into the
upvalue. A binding a closure captures from inside a loop with `let`, which
needs a fresh binding each turn, is closed at the end of each turn by
`close_upvals`. A binding captured by value -- a constant, a strict
parameter no one assigns -- is copied into the closure as now. The `closure`
instruction carries, for each of the new function's upvalues taken from its
maker, the register of the binding, so that the function's template needs
nothing of the maker's layout.

## Inline caches

Every property, element, global and call site has an entry in the
function's caches, numbered by the backend with no 16-bit limit (the wide
forms above). The loop checks a site's entry in the case, with one test
for a hit, and calls out for anything else:

- **A property read or write** compares the object's shape with the entry's
  own shape and reads or writes the slot; a prototype's property, an
  accessor, a polymorphic or megamorphic site is out of line. This is the
  existing `propCache` and its `ownShape`, which both forms share.
- **A global** reads or writes the slot its site remembers while the global
  epoch is the one the site was filled at: the shape tree's `globalEpoch`,
  which the JIT's global reads trust too, advances when a binding of the
  global object moves, goes or changes its attributes and when a
  script-level lexical binding is declared, which may shadow a global. A
  site is filled at the epoch only for a plain data property -- a writable
  one for a write -- of a global object of a layout of its own, which no
  lexical binding shadows (`regNoteGlobal`); the epoch, kept per closure
  template beside its sites (`regEpochs`), is one compare where the read
  compared the layout and looked the name up in the lexical table.
- **An element** of a dense array is read or written inline for an index
  that is an int32 in range; holes, typed arrays and the rest are out of
  line.
- **A call** compares the callee with the function the site last called and
  enters its register code without asking again what kind of function it
  is.

## The tree tier and the JIT

During the migration the tree tier and the JIT keep consuming the stack
form, which the stack compiler still emits for every function: a function
with register code is run by the register interpreter, and a function
without it by the tiers that run it today.

Whether the tree tier is still needed is a measurement, not a choice. The
kernels show the register interpreter level with it on `am3`, the loop its
int32 nodes were written for, and 1.8x faster on moves and 1.35x on calls.
When the register interpreter is at least level with the tree tier on every
suite and micro-benchmark, plain and at `GOMAXPROCS=1`, the tree tier is
retired; until then each function runs on whichever the measurements
choose, and the int32 and bitwise paths that make Crypto fast stay where
they are.

The JIT builds its SSA from the stack form today. It moves to reading
register code, which maps more directly onto SSA -- a register is a
variable, an instruction one value -- and its deoptimization then rebuilds
a register frame, which is simpler than an operand stack because every
value has a name. That is a stage of its own, after the interpreter covers
the language, and the JIT's README is updated with it.

## The debugger, eval and with

- **The debugger.** Code compiled for a debugger has a `debug` instruction
  at each statement, where a pause or a breakpoint can happen, as the stack
  form's `debug_stmt`; the binding table above tells it which register
  holds each name in scope. A debugger's assignment to a binding writes the
  register.
- **A direct eval** reads and writes its caller's bindings through
  descriptors that name their registers, as they name slots today.
- **A `with` body** resolves its names dynamically; the function keeps the
  stack form's dynamic lookups for names inside one, as operations of the
  register form's own.

A direct eval and a `with` are compiled (Stage 2, item 8), and so is the
debugger's code (item 10).

## Stages

Each stage lands on its own, is measured against the one before by the
placements, plain and with the JIT, and keeps test262 at 100,247 passed and
none failed in every mode -- plain, with the JIT, with every runtime made
`WithDebugger`, and in the register tier. What a stage does not cover runs
on the old pipeline -- until the end state, in which the stack interpreter
and the tree tier are removed. So no new feature is left to them, not for
a form, not for a while, not because the tree is faster: what is added
runs entirely as register code. The fallbacks there are -- regcomp's
refusals (the inventory below) -- are a list to burn down, not a
design. The tree tier is
the floor to beat and the place to port mechanisms from, never a place to
send code.

### Stage 0: the evidence (done)

The translation reference (`6ae14dca`) and the hand-written kernels
(`cff0c8ab`) above: the operations are specialised, the loop is its own,
the register window and the code are unchecked, the switch has no range
check, and nothing a case keeps is live across a call.

Both were removed once the backend (regcomp) covered what they measured:
the translation (`internal/compiler/regform`, `QJS_REGFORM`), the kernels
(`QJS_REGHAND`) and the eight operations only the translation emitted --
`closure`, `bin_imm`, `jmp_cmp`, `jmp_cmp_imm`, `call`, `call_method`,
`new` and `close_upvals` -- with their cases, slow paths and tests. Their
figures stay recorded above; the commits named there keep the code.

### Stage 1: plain functions

- The AST backend for plain functions and arrows: simple parameters,
  `var`, `let` and `const` of identifiers, expressions, `if`, the loops
  without `for-in` and `for-of`, `break` and `continue`, `return`, calls,
  `new`, object and array literals, closures. Anything else leaves the
  function without register code.
- The loop at the comparison engine's cost an instruction on the kernels:
  the dispatch's saves removed, the big-function size pinned by a test.
- `regEnter` with the lean frame record for calls between register
  functions, and the direct entry from built-ins' callbacks.
- Globals with the lexical epoch; `get_method` into the call window;
  immediate element indices.
- The register tier opt-in (`QJS_REG`), then the default for the functions
  it covers once its measurements show a net gain.

To ship, it needs: test262 in all four modes with the register tier on, its
own tests for each mechanism (a count of register functions built, a call
made without the generic path, a site filled once), the micro-benchmarks
and the V8 suite over the placements, and the hot functions unchanged by
`hotdiff`.

#### Where stage 1 stands

The backend (`internal/compiler/regcomp`) compiles from the AST and the
record of the stack compiler's resolution (`regrecord.go`), and covers
nearly every function of Richards, DeltaBlue, NavierStokes, Splay and
RayTrace; `disasm -reg` lists its code beside the stack form's, 20 to 35%
fewer instructions in their methods. The stack form is unchanged:
compilediff against `ce98c3cf` writes the same output. test262 in register
mode passes what the default build passes on this checkout.

What the measurements found, against the design:

- **The loop's size is a cliff, not a slope.** With the specialised
  compare-and-branches each carrying its own slow path, `runReg` passed
  Go's big-function size, and every helper of cost above 20 became a call:
  `regInt32`, `lexShadows`, `regTruthy`. `crypto_am3` went from 102 to 137
  ns. The cases now share three tails after the switch -- the slow path, the
  compare's slow path, the taken jump -- reached by `goto`, and a case is a
  fast path and a jump.
- **Store forwarding hides the loads Go keeps.** A `struct` the loop stores
  its pc to before a call is forwarded to the load after it unless the
  callee is given the struct's address; given it, the pc is no longer live
  across the call. The dispatch still saves the pc and the instruction
  where a case's fast path needs more registers than there are; the
  comparison engine's dispatch saves three values too, so this is not the
  difference between the two.
- **Numbers as float64 cost index-heavy code.** NavierStokes runs as
  register code throughout and is 27% slower than the tree tier, which
  keeps an int32 it has proven in a Go variable; every `get_index` here
  converts its key from a float. The tree tier's int32 paths stay where
  they win: a function the tree builds with int32 nodes keeps its tree.
- **A per-function fallback multiplies the boundaries.** EarleyBoyer and
  Splay are 39% and 30% slower: a tree-tier function calling a register
  function goes through `callTree`, `runTreeNested` and a copy of the
  window, and the reverse through `callDirect`; the gate's "fast boundary"
  needs the tree's call nodes to enter register code as `regDirect` does,
  and constructors (`new`) to run as register frames.
- **Fusions the stack form has are owed.** `prop_update` (`o.a += j`) is
  three instructions a statement here against one tree node, 16.6 against
  6.4 ns; the backend needs the update of a place as one operation, as the
  tree has it. (Done since: `add_prop`, 5.8 ns.)
- **A call's cost was its general path's.** `regCallW` was 30% of
  `call_fib`, most of it spills of the paths a cache hit never takes. The
  hit is now the whole of `regCallW`: the callee's tag and pointer read as
  words (read as a `Value`, the tag went through a float register and the
  stack to be compared), the cache's kind saying what to write or check of
  the this, the frame's facts read from the register code (new.target
  read, registers captured), and the call's value written to `R[B]` by the
  call, so the loop keeps nothing of the instruction across it. A first
  call, a leaf, a frame keeping its arguments and a this to coerce are out
  of line. `call_fib` 39.2 to 32.3 ns, `method_call` 64.2 to 48.7,
  Richards -11%, DeltaBlue -20% over the placements.
- **Index-heavy loops need the tree's fusions.** `x[++i]`
  (`get_index_pre`), a compare-and-branch with an upvalue (`jle_upval`, a
  loop's bound a closure captures) and an element's store made in the
  binding its value goes on to take `lin_solve`'s inner loop from 19
  instructions a turn to 13; NavierStokes -10% over the placements.
- **The pc saved at every dispatch came from three cases.** jfalse and
  jtrue called `Truthy`, `===` called `StrictEquals`, and the dead-zone
  check passed `pc-1`. With those answered inline or on the slow path
  (`regTruth`; `===` of two numbers or of a value compared by its words),
  Go stores only the instruction word at the dispatch: `crypto_am3` 100 to
  91 ns, NavierStokes -5%, Crypto -6%, the V8 total -3.9% over two
  placements.
- **A call's window is filled by the read of its method.** `get_method_w`
  reads `o.m` of a receiver in a binding and puts the receiver in the
  window beside it, the move gone (`method_call` 49 to 45 ns). A leaf
  callee is answered in `regCallW` before anything of the frame is
  written, and a pure body the frameless evaluator has given up on leaves
  the site's leaf kind. `method_call_leaf` stays near 38 ns against the
  tree's 31: the tree's one node is six register instructions here.
- **Trivial bodies and built-ins at the call site.** A body whose first
  instruction returns a parameter, or nothing, is answered by `regCallW`
  from the window (`regLeafArg`, `regLeafUndef`), not by the frameless
  evaluator: `method_call_leaf` 40 to 25 ns against the tree's 31. A
  built-in of this realm is a kind of the site's cache (`regCallNative`),
  called by `regNative` as `callDirect` calls one -- Math's functions,
  push and pop and the native leaves without a frame -- rather than
  through `regCallSlow`, `regCall` and `callDirect`'s search:
  `array_push` 70 to 52 ns, `array_pop` 64 to 45.
- **Strict global stores and lazy arguments.** A strict store of a value
  that runs no code asks at the store whether the name resolves
  (`set_global` with X=1), as the stack form's folded `set_global_strict`
  does; `arguments.length` and `arguments[i]` of a function whose object
  is made on demand are `args_len` and `args_index`. The V8 suite has no
  refusal left that costs a crossing.
- **x[i++] is one operation** (`get_index_post`). First measured slower
  (`crypto_am3` 91 to 101 ns at two placements) against a base whose pads
  were off their targets; with both builds' pads regenerated, at four
  placements, `crypto_am3` is 2% faster and Crypto 1 to 4% at every one.
  NavierStokes, which has no `x[i++]`, is 23% slower at one placement and
  level at the others: the case moves the loop's code, which that
  placement puts on a bad alignment (the second of `-k 4`'s placements,
  placement 3: 54.7 to 67.5 ms, reproduced in two runs). The cliff is in
  the layout of the cases inside `runReg`, which the lock does not hold;
  it is left to the step that lays out the loop, the call routine and the
  entry as one block the lock anchors. `get_method_w`, re-measured the same
  way, stays: without it `method_call` is 7% slower at every placement and
  the V8 total slower at every one. The
  loop's own alignment moves the small loops: `loop_locals` is 10.4 to 11.3
  ns with `runReg` at 32 mod 64 and 13.1 at 0, which the placements do not
  vary.
- **What the tree's mechanisms gave, register code gives too.** The
  package's tests in register mode found wrong answers and costs the
  differential test had not: a trace read the heap frame's this and
  new.target, which the lean call does not write -- a frame's `regKind`
  now says they are its window's -- and placed a call at its expression's
  start; a block's `let` hid a function expression's own name; an apply
  other than the built-in was given a new arguments object each call,
  now one kept in the binding's register (`apply_args`'s C); a computed
  key both read and written ran an object's toString twice, now
  converted once (`key_of_base`, the stack form's
  `to_property_key_of_base`), which a key an operator made, a
primitive, does without. The tree's
  mechanisms the register code lacked are its own now: `concat` and
  `str_part`, the stack form's string chain, one string made where an
  addition made one each; closures that take a value by value
  (`newClosureByValue` reading registers); a loop's function expression
  made once (the record's `Reused`); `in` through the realm's cache; and
  a leaf's property reads and stores on the stack form's sites
  (`propSite`), which the frameless evaluators read, so that a run of its
  register code fills them. With the tree tier off, the stack
  interpreter runs everything, register code included.
- **What a call answers without a frame, every entry answers.** A body
  that returns a constant is answered at the call site as one returning a
  parameter is (`regLeafConst`): `func_call` 34 to 19 ns against the
  tree's 28. A built-in's callback enters through `regDirect`, which now
  answers the same bodies -- a constant, a parameter, a short pure body
  through `pureCall`, a this-leaf through `leafCall` -- as `callDirect`
  does a function without register code; a register closure is planned at
  `closure_w`, so its callbacks had skipped that and made a frame each:
  `map_forEach` and `set_forEach` -19%, `typed_forEach` -22%. A pure body
  `pureByTree` gives a tree is entered as code: `forward_call6`'s
  six-operand sum was 11% slower through the evaluator.
- **An empty literal learns its room** (`new_array_empty`, the tree's
  `arrayEmptyNode` and its site): `array_push_args3` grew every array
  from nothing, -29%.
- **An element's update is one operation.** `o[k] += v` and `o[k]++` as
  statements are `add_index` (a key and a value in registers),
  `add_index_k` (a 16-bit index) and `add_index_imm` (an immediate value),
  on `add_prop`'s conditions: the value a constant or a binding no one
  else writes. The key is converted once; the instruction is placed at the
  key, where the stack form reads, and Aux names the stack form's store,
  whose position a store's error takes. `array_update` 18 to 6 ns.
- **A negative literal is an immediate** wherever a literal is
  (`numberLit`): `!== -1`, `x + -1`, `x > -2`, a switch's cases.
- **A switch's literal cases are one lookup** (`switch`, the table in
  `Switches`): each run of cases whose selectors are literals -- numbers,
  strings, booleans, null -- between cases of other selectors, made as the
  tree's `switchLookup` makes its table: integers of a small range by an
  index, strings by length, then the constant's pointer, then their units.
  `switch (typeof x)` of string cases asks x's type (`switch_typeof`), and
  `typeof x === "name"` is one compare-and-branch (`jtypeof`), an object's
  type asked inline but a proxy's and document.all's. `typeof` is an
  operation of its own, out of the loop. `string_switch_*` were 5 to 11
  times the tree's time, a slow-path `===` a case; `typeof_test` 3 times.
  An empty literal's array is made by a call of its own, not the slow
  path's.
- **A typed array's element is out of line, not the slow path's.**
  `get_index`, `set_index` and their immediate forms answer a dense
  element inline and send what they miss to `regElemMiss`, which reads or
  writes a typed array's element in its buffer as `elemAt` and `setElem`
  do, before the slow path: `typed_*_read` 24 to 15.5 ns and
  `typed_*_write` 24 to 14 against the tree's 13 and 14. get_index and the
  immediate forms reach it through a label they share, a jump each in the
  loop; set_index calls it before its own slow-path call, since with the
  case made shorter the cases after it moved and `crypto_am3` was 5.5%
  slower at every placement. An update of a number in place (`add_prop`,
  `add_index`) writes the number's word alone, as the tree's updates do,
  with no write barrier's check: `array_update` 6.3 to 5.9 ns,
  `prop_update` 5.5 to 5.1.
- **A short body of numbers and upvalues runs as its register code
  without a frame** (`regLeafCode`, `regLeafRun`): a pure body that is
  straight code to its first return, of at most 12 loads, moves, upvalue
  reads and stores and arithmetic operations, reading neither the
  callee's register nor its this's and writing no parameter's register --
  a counter, an accumulator, a callback that maps or reduces numbers and
  counts its calls. It is translated once into operations numbered
  densely (`regLeafOp`), whose switch is a jump table, and run in the
  call's window by `regCallW` and `regDirect` (which writes only the
  parameters' arguments there). Its stores to upvalues, at most four, are
  held until it returns, and none is read after it is made, so what is no
  number gives up having changed nothing, and the call is made with a
  frame, as the frameless evaluator's misses are, counted by the same
  `pureMiss`. `pureCallAt` dispatched each stack instruction through a
  switch of scattered cases, and gave up on a store made before an
  operation: `func_closure_call` 40 to 30 ns over the placements (the
  tree 33), `closure_counter` -22%, `array_reduce` -15%,
  `array_reduce_upvalue` 59 to 48 (the tree 62).
- **An element appended or a hole filled is out of line too**
  (`regElemMiss`, the tree's `setIndexMiss`: `appendElem`, `fillHole`),
  not the slow path's: `array_prop_create` 54 to 44 ns and
  `array_index_append` 56 to 48 in one build (the tree 33 and 36).
  set_index's miss asks an array for them first, in a function of its own
  (`regSetMiss`), as the tree's `setIndexMiss` does, rather than after
  `regElemMiss`'s typed array, `setElem` and `typedStore`, which an array
  the fast path missed never answers: 41 to 31 ns and 45 to 34 in one
  build.
- **A string's length is the loop's,** as an array's is: `get_length`
  answered only arrays inline and sent a string to the slow path, where the
  tree's node answers both. `string_length` 15.6 to 7.0 ns in one build
  (the tree 8.1, the comparison engine 5.5).
- **A local's appends grow its string in place,** as the tree's do
  (`strAppend`): the stack compiler, which decides which additions are
  appends (`localAppend`) and which reads are followed by a `str_freeze`,
  records both for the backend (the Record's `Appends` and `Freezes`), so
  that the two forms agree on every binding. An append is `append`; a
  recorded read the register form makes a value of -- a move, an
  argument, a store, a return -- is preceded by `str_freeze` of the
  binding's register. A read the register form makes no value of, a
  compare's operand or a step, keeps nothing and is not frozen, and
  `x.length` is no read for either form. A short circuit around an append
  whose value nothing uses (`r !== l && (t += x)`) is an append too.
  Both are cases of their own since the loop's budget was measured and
  its tails shared ("The loop"): `append` a call of `regAppend` with the
  pc kept, `str_freeze` its test inline, writing only a string an append
  owns. Before that, with `append` the slow path's and `str_freeze`
  `regCold`'s (d931057d), the loop had 19 nodes to spare, and over the
  placements `string_build1` was 52.6 to 34.7 ns, `template_numbers` 130
  to 101, `local_append_read` 60 to 43, `template_list` 356 to 312, but
  `local_append_keep`, `local_append_once`, `append_keep_each` and
  `append_keep_pair` 5 to 9% slower than before, a read's freeze and an
  append each a second dispatch and a call. As cases: `string_build1`
  30.5 (the tree 32.4, the comparison engine 49.2), `string_build_large1`
  29.8, `local_append_keep` 62.8 (the tree 65.6, the comparison engine
  62.4), `local_append_read` 41.0 (43.6, 58.0), `append_keep_each` 130
  (135, 120), `local_append_once` 144 (167, 100).
- **An object literal of plain keys is made at once**
  (`new_object_lit`): its values go into registers in order and one
  operation, behind `regCold`, makes the object with its site's room and
  takes each key's transition, where `new_object` and a `define_field`
  each went through the slow path. The values evaluated before the object
  is made is a difference nothing can see: the object is no one's until
  the literal is done. A computed key, an accessor, a method, a spread,
  `__proto__`, a key twice or more than 255 keys keep the form of one
  instruction each. `object_literal_fixed` 171 to 127 ns in one build (the
  tree 101), 197 to 141 over the placements. Where every key was added
  along a transition from the site's root, the site keeps the shape they
  led to (`propCache`'s `next`, its root in `s1`), as the tree's literal
  node does, and the next object from that root is given its values in
  place and that shape: 141 to 105 ns in one build, the tree 109.
- **s.charCodeAt(i) is one operation** (`char_code_at`), as the tree's
  `charCodeAtCall` node is: a receiver in a binding, the argument a local
  no one else writes in one of the first 256 registers (X). `regCharCodeAt`
  reads the code unit where the receiver is a string, the method the
  built-in found in the cache of a primitive prototype's data properties
  that `primProp` fills, and the argument a number; anything else is the
  read and the call as `get_method_w` and `call_method_w` make them, the
  read placed at its own position (Aux) and the call at the
  instruction's. The case is a call with the pc kept, 27 nodes. The slow
  path of a method's read on a string or a number reads the same cache
  before `getValueProp`. Over the placements, `html_escape_entities` 2,538
  to 1,813 ns (the tree 1,924, the comparison engine 1,878),
  `html_escape_mixed` 800 to 636, `int_toString` 81.5 to 77.1 (the tree
  70, the comparison engine 82); the V8 suite level.
- **A RegExp literal is register code** (`QJS_REGEXPLIT` and
  `QJS_REGCALLS` removed). As a `new_regexp` through the slow path it made
  `template_list` 304 to 228 ns, but every function with a literal lost
  the tree's mechanisms around it: the literal's RegExp given back after
  `/x/.exec(s)` and `test` (`regexpLitMethod`, the spares), a literal
  handed to `replace`, `split` or `match` searched without its object
  (`regexpArgCall`), and an exec's array made again in the memory of the
  last (`reuseExecCall`) or not at all where nothing reads it
  (`regexp_sticky` 255 to 377 ns, eleven regexp tests 6 to 48% slower).
  As cold operations (`lit_exec`, `call_lit`, `call_arg_lit`,
  `call_dead`, `call_reuse`), two second dispatches a call, `regexp_replace`
  was still 25% and `html_escape_plain` 8.3% slower.

  Now the call is always the hot `call_method_w`, and what the tree's
  nodes do around it is a **mark** of the call (`RegCode.Marks`:
  `RMarkDead`, `RMarkReuse`, `RMarkLitRecv`, `RMarkLitArg`, their operand
  in `Aux`, all 32 bits), which changes nothing of the dispatch: the site's
  discovery (`regCallSlow`) caches a callee as `regCallMarked` only where
  the mark is its -- the realm's exec, test or replace, any callee for a
  literal argument, a reuse only where `execReuseOf` has a site -- and
  `regCallW` sends those to `regMarkedCall`; every other callee keeps its
  kind. Marked where no reuse site existed, the call went through
  `callRest` with a frame where `regNative` had none, 10% slower: a mark
  applies only where it does something. A literal argument is made by the
  call itself (`RMarkLitArg`): nothing can see it made after the
  arguments that follow. The literal's method is `regexp_lit`, a direct
  operation (value 29): the literal made or given back and its method
  chosen; with `RLitCall`, for one argument that is a constant or a local
  nothing captures in a function with no arguments object -- which the
  method's read, a getter, could neither write nor see uninitialized --
  the call made at once, the built-in called without the window. Any
  other argument is evaluated between `regexp_lit` and the marked call:
  the method must be read before it. A constant past 16 bits keeps the
  general form (`new_regexp` and the call), never a refusal.

- **The opcode space was full but for two values.** The dispatch masks the
  operation to 7 bits so that its jump table needs no range check, and
  with `char_code_at` 126 of the 128 values were taken. Widening the mask
  costs a case value for each of the 128 new values, more than the loop's
  budget. The translation reference's operations, which the backend never
  emits, were removed with it (see stage 0): their eight values are free,
  and `cold`, the one value every cold operation shares, took 126 (the
  opcode allocation rule, under "The loop").

#### Raw int32 registers (step 5, designed, deferred)

Index-heavy code pays a float conversion at every element access: a key
held as a float64 is converted to an index, and an int32 result back to a
float. The tree tier avoids it by keeping an int32 it has proven in a Go
variable. The register form does the same by static typing in the backend,
not by a new tag in `Value` -- an int32 tag cost floats 58% when it was
tried (2026-10-02).

- **What a register slot holds.** A register is a `Value`: a float64 word
  and a pointer word. A register the backend has proven to hold an int32
  for the whole of its live range -- a loop counter, an index, a bitwise
  result -- may hold it raw: the int32 in the number word, the pointer word
  nil. Which registers are raw is a fact of the code, not of the value: no
  instruction asks.
- **Why the collector is safe.** The collector scans only the pointer
  word, which in a raw register is nil, as in a number's. The number word
  is never read as a pointer.
- **Who may read one.** Only operations specialised for raw operands --
  `add_i32`, `inc_i32`, compare-and-branch on raw int32s, `get_index` and
  `set_index` with a raw key -- read a raw register. Every generic reader
  needs the conversion to a `Value` first (`box_i32`): a call's window, a
  return, a store to a property or an element, a move into a `Value`
  register, any slow path's operand. A binding a closure captures, a
  generator's window, a debugger's scope, a direct eval's binding and a
  stack trace's frame are never raw: only registers private to the frame's
  straight code qualify.
- **The verifier enforces it.** It tracks each register's kind, `Value` or
  raw int32, along every path: kinds propagate over jumps, both sides of a
  join at a label or a handler's entry must agree (a mixed join is
  rejected), and code where a generic reader can see a raw register is
  rejected. An instruction on raw registers that can call out -- a back
  edge's interrupt check, a stack overflow, a throw -- may have no raw
  register live where the callee or the unwinder reads the frame
  generically. The interpreter's correctness rests on the verifier, not on
  the backend's care.
- **Overflow.** An int32 operation whose result does not fit -- past 2^31,
  or -0 from a multiplication -- leaves the raw form through a boxed
  `Value` register the backend reserves for it, and continues on the
  generic path. Until that path exists the backend proves int32-ness only
  for what cannot overflow: masks, shifts, `| 0`, counters bounded by an
  int32 limit.
- **Tested by difference.** A differential test runs the micro-benchmark
  files, the V8 suite's programs and generated int32 arithmetic -- overflow
  past int32, -0, NaN, shifts by 32 or more, `>>> 0`, mixes with doubles --
  with the register tier on and off, and compares every result.
  (Built: `internal/v8bench/regdiff_test.go`, run after every step.)

Deferred, 2026-11-09, on these measurements:

- **NavierStokes' keys are not provable.** In `lin_solve` and
  `lin_solve2`, which are its time, every element key is `j * rowSize`,
  and `rowSize` is an upvalue made from `setResolution`'s argument: no
  static proof reaches it. What the backend could prove are the loop
  counters, compared with the upvalues `width` and `height`. The tree tier
  keeps those locals as Values and converts the same keys, and is still
  21% faster: its lead is fused nodes such as `x[++currentRow]`, not
  int32s, and the register form closes it by fusion and instruction count.
- **am3's operands are Values.** Its parameters `i`, `j`, `c` and `n` and
  every element read are Values; what is provable -- the masks, shifts and
  their products -- is about 13 of the loop's 26 instructions, 10 to 15% at
  best, for a verifier of kinds and a doubled set of operations.
- **Speculation is not taken.** Unboxing a parameter or an element read
  behind a check that exits to the generic code would type both loops, but
  brings exits, mapped generic code, twice the operations and a threat to
  `runReg`'s size into the interpreter, to remove a cost the faster tier
  pays too.

If this is ever built, the rule for calls out is the narrower one: no raw
register may be live where a callee or the unwinder reads the frame
generically -- a register a closure captures, a parameter an arguments
object maps, a call's window and the callee frame above it, a handler's
entry. An interrupt check, a stack check, a throw with no handler in the
frame and a ToPrimitive read nothing of the frame's registers, so a raw
loop counter may be live across a back edge; the literal rule, no raw
register live across anything that can call out, would forbid every raw
counter.

### Stage 2: zero refusals

The register tier is the baseline interpreter: it refuses nothing V8's
Ignition compiles, which in practice is everything. No form stays in the
old tiers, not generators, not eval, not the debugger's code; each is
compiled as register code, and the old tiers go when the last refusal
does. The refusals are counted by `internal/cmd/regrefusals`, which
compiles every file of the directories it is given with the register
form on and counts the functions regcomp compiled and those it refused,
by the first reason each met (a function refused for one reason may meet
another once it is gone):

```sh
go run ./internal/cmd/regrefusals D:/Data/v8-v7 D:/Data/octane D:/Data/bundles /path/to/test262/test
```

At 8474d6d0 (RegExp literals compiled; test262's negative tests, 4,728
files, do not compile and are not counted):

| | files | functions | register code | refused |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V8 suite | 10 | 820 | 808 (98.5%) | 12 |
| Octane | 21 | 6,976 | 6,801 (97.5%) | 175 |
| bundles (Babel, Three.js) | 2 | 9,829 | 6,234 (63.4%) | 3,595 |
| test262 | 54,084 | 162,893 | 63,090 (38.7%) | 99,803 |
| all | 54,117 | 180,518 | 76,933 (42.6%) | 103,585 |

| 2 | a lexical declaration in a switch | 0 / 0 / 1 |
| 1 | a site past 16 bits (a cap) | 0 / 1 / 0 |

Not in the corpora, and refused as well: code compiled for a debugger
(`WithDebugger`; done, item 10), a finally clause nested more than four
copies deep (done, item 11), and the caps -- more than 65,536 registers, a jump past 16
bits, a name past 16 bits, more than 255 arguments, properties or
elements in one instruction. A cap goes as a wide form, never a refusal.

The plan to zero, in the order of what each costs real code first -- the
V8 suite, Octane and the bundles -- and then test262, each form with its
regdiff cases and test262 in register mode on its directories:

1. **Tail calls** (2,819; 2,566 of the bundles', strict code's `return
   f()`) -- done. The stack compiler records the calls it makes tail calls
   (`Record.Tails`), and regcomp marks them (`RMarkTail`): the call is
   call_w or call_method_w as ever, and `regCallW` reads the mark only
   once the stack is `tailCallDepth` deep (behind one compare,
   `regDeepCall` past `maxFrames` or `tailCallDepth`). There, a
   callee of register code of the form's own layout that keeps no
   arguments takes the frame over in place (`regTailInPlace`): the
   frame's captured bindings closed, the arguments moved to the
   parameters, the loop going on from the callee's first instruction
   (`errRegRestart` in the fail tail), as the tree's `selfRestart` and
   `tailSwap` do -- unwinding to the caller each time made `tail_self`
   3.7 and `tail_mutual` 2.5 times the tree's. Any other frame that is no
   construct's and shares no derived constructor's this is given up as
   the stack form's `tail_call` gives it up: the call pending
   (`r.pendingTail`) and the loop leaving with `errTailCall`, which its
   caller makes: `regCallW`, `regCallMiss` and `regDirect` through
   `regCall`, whose loop makes every later call of a chain in place (a
   bound function resolved to its target there, as `tailTarget` does), and
   a frame the tree or run made through `treeTail`, as after
   `tailCallNode`. A function with a tail call is not given a `treeCall`
   (`regPlan`), whose callers expect none: `planTreeCall`'s `treeRest`.
   After it: Octane 98.7% register code, the bundles 89.0% (63.4%), all
   44.1%.
2. **Top-level code** (49,389, most of test262; every script and module)
   -- done for scripts and modules (`regcomp.CompileTop`, top.go): the
   body a function of registers, its bindings the global object's, the
   global lexical environment's or the module's. What it declares before
   its first statement the stack compiler records as it emits it
   (`Record.Top`): `check_global_lex`, `check_global_var`,
   `define_global_var`, `declare_global_lex`, `declare_module_lex` and
   `define_global_func` of each hoisted function's closure, made in that
   order as cold operations that do what executeAt's cases do
   (zzreg_top.go); a lexical declaration's store is `init_global_lex` or
   `init_module_lex` (`ResGlobalLexInit`, `ResModuleLexInit`), and a
   var's `set_global` whatever the strictness (`ResGlobalVar`). A
   module's declarations function (`<module bindings>`) is register code
   of no statements. The completion value is a register of its own
   (`Record.Completion`): an expression statement sets it once its value
   is made, the statements that may produce none reset it, and each copy
   of a finally clause keeps the try block's around the clause, as the
   stack form does -- whose copy before a break or a continue did not,
   and gave the clause's value where Node gives the block's (fixed with
   it). `typeof` of a name no binding resolves is `get_global_opt`
   (cold), which the fused `typeof x === "..."` takes too. A loop's
   backward jump records how many registers its head has live
   (`RegCode.BackLive`), and the sweep of stale slots clears the rest:
   a call's window kept what it was given until written over. A
   Program's register literals are seeded like its stack ones
   (`listSites`). Eval code, a module with top-level await and code
   compiled for a debugger are items 3 and 8.
3. **Generators, async functions, async generators, `for await` and a
   module's top-level await** (12,737) -- done ("Generators and async
   functions" above): the frame's window copied into the generator on a
   suspension, a return injected at a yield compiled as a return there,
   yield* and for await as loops of the code's own, an await's job going
   on in place at a settled value, and a for-of's step of a register
   generator with no recover. The JIT learns no register generator
   (`jitGenSeen`, `jitGenMakeable`).
3b. **Captured lexical bindings in loops** (878, with catch bindings and
   a head expression's closure of the head's binding) -- done: each
   turn's binding is a new one by closing the captures open on its
   register (`close_regs`) where the binding is made again -- a block's
   entry, a for-of or for-in turn's head, a catch clause's entry, its
   value waiting in a temporary meanwhile -- so that the closures of the
   turns before keep theirs, closed. A for head's let is copied from turn
   to turn (CreatePerIterationEnvironment): closed after the head's
   initialization and at each turn's end, before the update. A head
   expression's closure of the head's binding reads it in its dead zone,
   the bindings the stack compiler records for the head (`Record.Heads`).
3c. **Names in their dead zone, and for-of and for-in stores** (626 and
   721) -- done: the stack compiler records a dead-zone upvalue's read and
   write as `ResUpvalCheck` (`get_upval_check`, `set_upval_check`, cold,
   the dead zone outranking constness), a binding of its own function
   written before its declaration as `ResLocalCheck` (`check_ref` and a
   move), and a function expression's own name written as the constant's
   store or nothing, by strictness. A for-of or for-in loop stores each
   turn's value to any binding a store reaches: a global var, a global
   or a module's let, a checked binding, a constant (which throws). Their arguments object is made by
   the creation's run, from the arguments the generator keeps; a mapped
   one's aliases are captures of the parameters' registers, which move
   with the window.
4. **Classes** (about 27,000 together: constructors, accessors, fields,
   static blocks, private members and methods, `super`, `new.target`,
   class expressions inside functions, and a module's `export default
   class {}`) -- done (regcomp's class.go, the VM's zzreg_class.go). The
   stack compiler records what it made of each class (`Record.Classes`,
   a `ClassRec`): the slots of the class scope's bindings -- its inner
   name, its private names' keys, its list of private methods, its
   computed field keys -- and the constants of the constructor, the
   instances' field initializer, each member's function and each static
   field's or block's, in the order they run; and where each private
   name's key is (`Record.Privates`, a register or an upvalue). The
   register form makes the class in the stack form's order with cold
   operations of the stack form's instructions' names (`new_class`,
   `define_method`, `class_getter` and the rest, `private_name`,
   `add_private_method`, `define_private`, `set_field_init`), the static
   elements called as methods of the class, and closes the class scope's
   captured bindings at its end (`close_regs`), so that a class made in
   a loop gives each evaluation's methods their own. A field initializer's
   `FieldInit` is `define_index` or `define_private` on this, and its
   `InstallPrivateMethods` `install_private_methods`. A private member is
   read, written, updated, called and tested (`#x in o`) through its
   key's register (`get_private`, `set_private`, `private_in`, the name
   for the errors in the instruction's Aux); `super.x`, `super[k]` and
   `super.m()` through `super_get`, `super_set`, `super_base` and the
   index forms, the frame's this written to the record first. A derived
   constructor's this, and an arrow's written inside one, is the binding
   super() binds (`RegCode.ThisRef`): `this_bound` reads it, checked,
   `super_call` (`super_forward` for the constructor a derived class is
   given, `super_spread`) binds it, and every return goes through
   `derived_ret` (`derivedResult`); `regStmt` runs such a frame. A class
   constructor has no direct call path (`regPlan`, `regCallSlow`): a call
   throws, and a construction goes through construct and runFD. The stack
   form's this before super(), a private method's read for a call and a
   read in the dead zone had no position of their own (fixed with it).
   After it, with the strict global store (item 7): all corpora 89.6%
   register code (70.0%), Octane 99.9%, the bundles 94.1%.
5. **Parameter patterns, defaults and rest; destructuring everywhere**
   (declarations, assignment targets, catch clauses, for-of and for-in
   heads; about 4,500) -- done (regcomp's pattern.go). A pattern unpacks
   a register in the stack form's order: an array pattern's cursor is
   for_of_start's, stepped by `iter_step` and `iter_rest` (cold) and
   closed by `iter_close` at the end, its steps in the ranges of a
   handler of the cursor's that closes it for a throw (`iter_close_throw`,
   which an iterator whose `next` threw has marked done), as a for-of
   body's; an object pattern checks its source (`check_coercible`), reads
   each key -- a computed one converted first (`to_property_key`) -- after
   its leaf's object and key are evaluated, and makes its rest
   (`object_rest`) leaving out the keys it read, kept in a window, each
   evaluated once (the stack form evaluated a computed one again for the
   rest: fixed with it, as Node has it). A default replaces undefined,
   the source copied first where it is a binding a store may assign. A
   list of parameters with a default, a pattern or a rest binds them in
   order: those a checked read or a closure may see wait in a register of
   their own while the parameter is in its dead zone (`paramsAside`), and
   a rest is `rest_param` over the arguments the frame keeps
   (`RegCode.KeepsArgs`). A for-of or for-in head's pattern or property is
   unpacked at the head of each turn, inside the iterator's handler.
6. **BigInt literals** (1,912), **templates and tagged templates** (661),
   **object literals of every property kind** (1,482) -- done, with
   spreads, holes, optional chains, `??`, logical assignment and
   assignment to a constant (regcomp's literal.go). A BigInt is a
   constant. A template's parts go to a window that one `concat` joins,
   converting each with ToString; a substitution is converted at once
   (`to_string`, cold) only where a later part may run code, which could
   see the order. A tagged template is a call, a method's with its
   receiver, given its site's object (`template_object`, the site the
   stack compiler records, `Record.Templates`). An object literal's other
   properties are cold operations doing what the stack form's do:
   `copy_data_props` (a spread), `define_getter`, `define_setter` and
   their computed forms, `define_index` after `to_property_key`,
   `set_func_name`, `set_home_object` and `set_proto_of` (`__proto__:
   v`); a number key is a computed one. An array's hole is the
   uninitialized marker in its window; with a spread, the elements
   before it are made at once and the rest pushed or spread
   (`array_push`, `array_spread`), and a call or a `new` with a spread is
   `call_spread` of such an array. An optional link checks its object
   with `jnot_null`, and where that falls through, === undefined and
   === null, so that document.all's stand-in goes on; a nullish link
   jumps to the chain's end, where it is undefined, and `(o?.m)()` keeps
   its receiver. `??` is the same check; `a ||= b`, `&&=` and `??=` read
   the target once, a computed key converted once (`key_of_base`), and
   store only where the read does not decide. An assignment to a constant
   throws (`assign_const`). The stack form's reads in an optional chain
   had no position of their own (fixed with it).
7. **The arguments object in every form** (354), **names the backend does
   not read** (434, 335 of the bundles'), names the record does not
   resolve (92), strict global stores (96). The strict global store of a
   value that runs code is done: whether the name resolves is settled
   before the value is made and reported after it, `check_global_ref`
   and `assert_resolved`, as the stack form's. A strict function that
   ends in a tail call makes its arguments object as any other: an
   unmapped one is a copy, which a frame taken over in place leaves
   alone (69). A function that names eval without calling it has an
   arguments binding the stack form fills for an eval that never comes;
   nothing reads it, it has no register, and none is made (217). What
   the record did not resolve was one form, 642 functions of test262's:
   dynamic import, `import(x)`, `import.source(x)` and
   `import.defer(x)`, whose callee the parser makes a name -- done: a
   cold `import` of the specifier and the options in a window, at the
   call's position, as the stack form's; `import.meta` is `import_meta`
   (cold).
8. **eval and `with`** (757 direct evals, 527 functions beside an eval's
   variables, a with or an Annex B function, 11 more) -- done. A call the
   stack form made a direct eval (`Record.Evals`, with its scope's index)
   is `direct_eval` (cold): the callee, its receiver and the arguments, or
   an array of them, in a window. Where the callee is the realm's eval and
   the first argument a string, the code is compiled and linked to the
   frame as evalIn links it to a heap frame's, each binding it names
   captured from its register (`RegCode.LocalReg`, the slot's register)
   as a closure's capture is, its this from register 1; otherwise it is
   an ordinary call, a tail call where marked. A function with a direct
   eval gives every binding a register and makes its arguments object as
   it starts, and is called through runFD, which makes the scope of its
   eval's variables. A name a with object or an eval's variable may
   answer is compiled as the stack form compiles it (`Record.Withs`, the
   probe and its limit): a cold probe of the innermost limit of the
   frame's with objects and eval's variables -- `with_get`,
   `with_get_this`, `with_delete`, `with_set` -- that sets a found flag
   in a register of its own, and a jump around the static access; a
   reference that is read and written, or resolved before its value is
   made, is `with_resolve` and then `with_read` and `with_write` through
   the object it found. A with statement's object is put on the frame's
   with objects by `with_push` and taken off by `with_pop`, compiled for
   each way out as a finally clause is, a throw's in a handler of its
   own. A frame runs as register code whatever with objects and eval's
   variables runFD gives it, and a generator keeps them across a
   suspension. The stack form probed a binding typeof reads twice
   (fixed with it). Eval code itself is register code too (item 9e).
9. **`using` and `await using`** (177) -- done (regcomp's try.go,
   `usingScope`): a statement list, a for head or a for-of head that
   declares with using is a scope whose resources are in a register of
   its own (`new_dispose_capability`), each value added as it is
   declared, before its binding is initialized (`add_disposable`), and a
   finally clause that disposes of them, compiled for each way out as
   any other: the normal end and each exit with no exception to fold in
   (`dispose`), a throw with the one it folds in. An await using scope's
   disposal is a loop of `dispose_step`s, each running the disposers
   until one leaves a value to await, which the loop awaits in a handler
   whose throw the next step folds in, as the stack form's
   compileDispose. Then the finally depth (completion dispatch, no cap),
   the debugger's code (statement markers in register code), and the
   caps.
9b. **Labelled statements that are no loop, declarations in switches,
   delete of a name** (69, 36 and 41) -- done. A labelled statement of any
   other kind is a target only a break naming it reaches (`loop.named`),
   and a statement's labels are a set (`labelSet`): `a: b: while` is the
   target of a break or a continue naming either, which the parser and
   the stack compiler took as b's alone (fixed with it). A switch's case
   block is one scope, entered once the discriminant is made
   (`enterBlock` of every case's statements). delete of a name is false
   for a binding and `delete_var` (cold) for a global, as the stack form
   resolved it (the record's read of the operand); delete of an optional
   chain's property deletes it, true where a link is nullish -- the stack
   form deleted nothing (fixed with it).
9c. **Function declarations in blocks, switches and behind labels**
   (128, and the Annex B functions of item 8's count) -- done. A block's
   functions are made as it is entered, after its lexical bindings, a
   closure's capture closed first in a loop (`enterBlock`); a labelled
   declaration is its list's, as an unlabelled one is (the stack form
   never made one: fixed with it). Annex B's var is assigned as the
   declaration is evaluated, with what the block's binding holds then
   (B.3.3.1), a store the stack compiler records as the declaration's
   name's write -- it assigned it as the block was entered, which Node
   does not (fixed with it).
9d. **The last refusals of the corpora** (40) -- done; the debugger
   statement outside a debugger's code does nothing, as the stack form's.
   - *A finally clause's bindings* (9, "a name the record resolves two
     ways"): the stack form compiles a clause once for each way out --
     inline at the normal end, as the handler's, and at each break or
     continue that leaves it (unwindTo) -- each copy's bindings in slots
     of their own (slots are never reused), so
     a name in it resolved to one slot in one copy and another in the
     next. The record keeps the first copy's notes and drops the later
     ones' (`Record.BeginFinally`); regcomp compiles all its copies from
     the first's slots, which no other binding has, and finds the first
     copy's function constants (`closure` by start).
   - *Sloppy code's assignment to a call* (12: `f() = v`, `f() += v`,
     `f()++`, `for (f() in o)`): the call made, then
     `throw_reference_error` (cold) at the target, the value never made,
     as the stack form's compileCallTarget. A logical assignment to a call
     is a syntax error, and the other targets are panics, not refusals.
   - *Annex B's `for (var a = init in o)`* (4): the initializer assigned
     once, before the object is made. *A let's own initializer storing
     it in its dead zone* (`let y = [y] = []`, 2): the pattern's store
     checks the dead zone as an assignment's does.
   - *The caps as wide forms.* A call of more than 255 arguments -- plain,
     a method's, an optional chain's, new, super(), a tagged template's,
     a direct eval's -- passes an array of them as a spread call does
     (`wideArgs`, `call_spread`); a spread call through an optional chain
     is chainCall's. An array literal of more than `arrayChunk` (1,024)
     elements makes that many at once and pushes the rest; a literal of
     constants past 16 bits names its count by its table's (new_array_k's
     B 0); an object literal's room is a hint, at most 65,535. A function
     with more cache sites, or call sites, than 16 bits number is compiled
     again with its sites shared by key (`site16`, `siteKey`): the kind of
     cache and the name, a literal's keys or constants, a call's
     operation -- entries that answer alike for every instruction of the
     key, a call's checked against its callee. A function whose stack
     form alone has nearly as many (Mandreel's global_init, 155,109;
     test262's string-upper-lower-mapping.js, 65,561) is compiled a
     third time with the register form's sites numbered first, from 1,
     shared by key, and the stack form's moved past them
     (`moveStackSites`: the B of every instruction the stack compiler
     gave a site, and the object literals' `LiteralKeys`): the two forms
     index one closure's caches, and only the register form's operands
     are 16 bits.
   - A jump of a 16-bit offset that does not reach (`errJumps`): the
     function is compiled again with every such jump far
     (`farJumps`), the branch taken to a `jmp` of 32 bits, past a
     `jmp` over it where it is not: three instructions where there was
     one, only in a function past 32,767 of them.
   - `with (o) f(...a)` passed no receiver in the stack form (fixed with
     it): a spread call probes with `with_get_this` as any call does.
9e. **Eval code** -- done. The top level a direct or an indirect eval
   evaluates, strict or sloppy, and the Function constructor's code, are
   compiled as any top-level code (`regScript` refuses only a debugger's),
   and so is every function written inside them, which the record skipped
   where the code had an eval scope. The caller's bindings are upvalues by
   name (`evalIn` captures them from the frame, its register for register
   code); a with object's names are probed as in the caller. A var or a
   function the code declares goes where the stack form's
   define_global_var and define_global_func put it: the global object, or
   inside a function the frame's eval variables (`f.evalVars`, which
   runFD gives the frame), which the cold `define_global_var` and
   `define_global_func` now do too. A function the code declares where
   the caller binds the name as a var is stored into that binding, as
   the stack form's storeVar does: a declaration of its own in the record
   (`TopOp` set_upvalue, of an identifier of its own, whose write the
   record resolves, a with object's probe included). The completion value
   of a with statement whose body produces none is undefined (fixed with
   it).
10. **The debugger's code** (`WithDebugger`) -- done. The stack compiler
   records each debug_stmt it makes by its position (`Record.Debugs`,
   the first copy's in a finally clause compiled more than once), and
   regcomp makes a cold `debug` at each statement, loop test and update
   and for-in or for-of head of that position, the statement's index in
   Aux: it does nothing unless a debugger has asked to stop, and then sets
   the frame's pc to the stack form's debug_stmt, by which the debugger
   finds the statement, its scope and its position, and asks the debugger
   as executeAt's case does. Every binding has a register, as beside a
   direct eval, and `RegCode.LocalReg` names it: a `DebugFrame` of a frame
   that runs as register code (`regDebugFrame`) reads and sets its
   bindings there (`Scopes`, `SetVariable`), its this in register 1, and
   evaluates code there as a direct eval of the register form's
   (`regEvalCode`). Breakpoints and steps are the statements' indexes, as
   in the stack form.
11. **Finally clauses nested past four copies** -- done (`finShared`). A
   try statement compiled inside `finallyDepth` copies of clauses has its
   clause compiled once, at its end, with a completion dispatch: each way
   in loads its kind in a register of the statement's -- 0 the block's
   normal end, 1 a throw from the handler, k > 1 an exit -- and jumps to
   the clause, after which compares of the kind (`RJSEqI`) go on: past the
   statement, to the throw again, or to the rest of exit k, the clauses
   outside and its jump or return, compiled there with the registers the
   exits keep live left alone. A clause inside one so compiled is
   compiled once too, so that the code grows with the nesting, not as
   its power. The stack form's copies of a clause with a try statement
   of its own lost the clauses outside it (fixed with it).
12. **Entries as register code's own** (`regRunFD`). What runFD would
   run -- a call through callObject or callDirect, a script's or an
   eval's code, a tree's call (callTreeWith) -- is entered as register
   code directly where the function has any (`fn.Reg`, which only
   register mode's compiler makes, so that the default tiers' paths test
   a field they hold already): its frame given what runFD gives one of
   its surroundings -- the with objects and the eval's variables of the
   functions around it, a scope for its own direct eval's -- and a chain
   of tail calls it ends in made in its place, in constant space
   (regTailLoop). A direct eval's function and one inside a with are so
   no longer entered through runFD, nor is a construction
   (constructRun, and callTreeWith whatever the new.target; planTreeNew
   gives register code no tree's) or a frame with a this binding: a
   derived constructor's construction makes the binding super() binds,
   an arrow written inside one shares it, and the frame record's this
   is register 1 at entry, which superCall reads and rebinds. Eval
   code's this is the call site's, which may be such a binding: top-level
   code records it (`Record.ThisRef`, the stack compiler's thisIsValue)
   and reads this through the binding, as such an arrow does. Strict
   eval code's function declarations, bindings of its own rather than
   top-level declarations, are made (they were not: test262's name-unicode.js,
   strict).
13. **The fallback counter** (`vm.RegFallbacks`, QJS_REGFALLTRACE to
   name each). Register mode counts every time it hands code to the
   other tiers: a function firstForm builds a tree for, having no
   register code; a frame regStmt runs in the stack interpreter; and
   register code entered through runTree, a frame runFD or callTree
   made rather than its own -- the node that runs register code in a
   tree is reached no other way. With constructions entered as
   register code (item 12) the count is zero, and the regdiff tests (the
   micro list, the V8 suite and every corpus of theirs) and test262 in
   register mode, every directory, fail on any.

### Stage 3: the JIT and the tree tier

The JIT's front end reads register code, or the AST, and its
deoptimization rebuilds register frames: with the stack interpreter and
the tree tier removed, the stack form is no input it can keep. The tree
tier is measured against the register interpreter suite by suite, its
mechanisms ported, and removed.

### Stage 4: one pipeline

The stack compiler stops emitting code; scope resolution stays as the
front end both backends shared. `executeAt` and the stack form's
instruction set go.
