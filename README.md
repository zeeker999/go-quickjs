# go-quickjs

A JavaScript engine for Go, reimplementing [QuickJS-NG] in pure Go.

No cgo, no WebAssembly, no C toolchain. It cross-compiles anywhere Go does.

```go
rt := quickjs.New()
defer rt.Close()

v, err := rt.Eval(`[1, 2, 3].map(x => x * 2).join("-")`)
fmt.Println(v) // 2-4-6
```

Three things live here:

| | |
|---|---|
| `quickjs` | the engine, to embed in a Go program |
| `qjs` | a command that runs JavaScript, with the capabilities you allow |
| `jsregexp` | ECMAScript regular expressions for Go, which RE2 cannot express |

```
go get github.com/go-quickjs/go-quickjs
go install github.com/go-quickjs/go-quickjs/cmd/qjs@latest
```

## Status

The language is substantially complete: expressions, closures, classes with
inheritance and private members, destructuring, generators, `async`/`await`,
Promises, regular expressions, modules with top-level `await`, Proxy, typed
arrays, explicit resource management and proper tail calls all work, as does
the web-compatibility annex, and all of it is exercised against [test262], the
official ECMAScript conformance suite.

`Intl` is there too, from [go-intl], a pure-Go implementation of ECMA-402 built
to answer as ICU 78.3 does in Node 26, with CLDR 48.2 data for every locale ICU
has -- rather than linking ICU -- including the Unicode collation order, where
a text may be broken into words and sentences, how a measurement is written,
how long something took, eighteen calendars, and what every time zone is
called in every language. It is held against a full ICU build:
[7,948 of 7,949 cases match it exactly](intl_test.go), and the one that does
not is named.

Of the 99,941 test262 variants in the areas the engine claims -- the language,
the built-ins, `Intl` and Annex B -- 99,599 pass, none fail, and 342 are
skipped because they require an unsupported feature or host facility. See [Conformance](docs/status.md#conformance) for the
measurement and [Not implemented](docs/status.md#not-implemented) for what is missing.

On the V8 benchmark suite as a whole it is ahead of C QuickJS: it takes 0.64
times QuickJS's time over the suite and has a 15% higher composite score.
Single operations cost about the same: QuickJS's own micro-benchmarks take
0.97 times as long on average, though a few take two to over three times as
long, the weak collections and BigInt arithmetic among them. See [Compared with C QuickJS](docs/benchmarks.md#compared-with-c-quickjs).

## Documentation

An experimental native tier for numeric and array loops is in development for
`linux/amd64`, `windows/amd64` and `darwin/arm64`. It needs both a build with
`-tags quickjs_jit` and a runtime made with `quickjs.WithJIT()` (or
`qjs --jit`); anything else runs exactly as before. See
[its notes](internal/jit/README.md) and
[the plan for it](docs/jit-production-plan.md).
