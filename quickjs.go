// Package quickjs embeds a JavaScript engine in a Go program.
//
// The engine is a pure-Go reimplementation of QuickJS: no cgo, no wasm, and no
// C toolchain. It cross-compiles anywhere Go does.
//
// # Running code
//
// A Runtime is one isolated JavaScript world. Create one, evaluate source, and
// close it when finished:
//
//	rt := quickjs.New()
//	defer rt.Close()
//
//	v, err := rt.Eval(`[1, 2, 3].map(x => x * 2).join("-")`)
//	if err != nil {
//	    return err
//	}
//	fmt.Println(v) // 2-4-6
//
// # Calling Go from JavaScript
//
// Set an ordinary Go function as a global and it becomes callable from script.
// Arguments and results are converted automatically:
//
//	rt.Set("add", func(a, b int) int { return a + b })
//	rt.Eval(`add(1, 2)`) // 3
//
// A function may return an error, which becomes a thrown JavaScript exception,
// and may take a *Runtime as its first parameter to call back into the engine.
//
// # Reading values back
//
// Decode follows the conventions of encoding/json, so a result can be read into
// an ordinary Go value:
//
//	var out struct {
//	    Name string `js:"name"`
//	    Age  int    `js:"age"`
//	}
//	v, _ := rt.Eval(`({name: "Ada", age: 36})`)
//	err := v.Decode(&out)
//
// # Untrusted code
//
// A Runtime has no I/O, no network access and no timers unless the host adds
// them, so a script cannot reach outside the engine on its own. Bound resources
// are set at construction:
//
//	rt := quickjs.New(
//	    quickjs.WithMemoryLimit(64<<20),
//	    quickjs.WithStackSize(1<<16),
//	    quickjs.WithMaxCallDepth(1000),
//	)
//
// Wall-clock bounds come from a context, which the interpreter checks as it
// runs, so an infinite loop is interrupted rather than hanging the process:
//
//	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)
//	defer cancel()
//	_, err := rt.EvalContext(ctx, `while (true) {}`)
//	// err wraps context.DeadlineExceeded
//
// # Concurrency
//
// A Runtime is not safe for concurrent use. Give each goroutine its own, which
// also isolates untrusted scripts from one another.

// digit is more than 999,999,999 places below the point, which the standard
// formats as the number it is. In the language it follows V8: strict code may assign to a call, which
// throws a ReferenceError when it runs; and Annex B hoists a function declared
// in a block over the arguments object, and over a function an enclosing
// block declares with the same name; and a script's global functions and vars
// are created in the order they are written, where the standard creates the
// functions first; and strict code assigning to a global name asks a proxy on
// the global object's chain nothing first, taking it to have the name, where
// the standard asks its has trap; and Iterator.prototype.take and drop take a
// finite count past 2^53 - 1, which the standard refuses; and a sloppy
// function's caller and arguments say what called it and with what, as every
// engine's accessors on Function.prototype do, where the standard has its
// %ThrowTypeError%, which throws; and Date.prototype.setYear reads the date's
// time value after converting the year, where the standard reads it first.
// Intl.DateTimeFormat
// refuses, with V8's RangeError, a Temporal plain date whose midnight, or a
// plain date-time, is past the instants a Date can hold, which the standard
// formats; and Intl.Locale answers a firstDayOfWeek keyword with no value as
// "true", where the standard answers ""; and Intl.Locale's maximize keeps a
// locale that names a language, a script and a region as it is, as ICU
// does, though the script is "Zzzz" or the region "ZZ", which the standard
// fills in: "en-Zzzz-US" rather than "en-Latn-US".
//
// Under it, as ICU does, Intl.NumberFormat writes an accounting amount with
// signDisplay "never" by the plain currency pattern, Norwegian -1 euro
// "1,00 €" where the standard writes "€ 1,00"; writes a currency in the
// format of the currency of the locale's region where that has one of its
// own, US dollars in en-DE "-US$1,234.50" rather than "-1.234,50 US$";
// and rounds a number to an increment other than 1 or 5 from ICU's fast
// reading of the double, which past about sixteen digits is not the double's
// own decimal -- though not a numeric string, which was never a double, nor
// formatRange's ends, which ICU's range formatter reads accurately; and
// writes a range whose ends are the same double but not the same number, a
// BigInt or a numeric string past an int64 among them, as the first marked
// approximate, "~0.1" where the standard writes "0.1–0.10000000000000000001".
// Intl.RelativeTimeFormat with numeric "auto" names in words any
// offset within 0.005 of a whole one from -2 to 2, 1.004 days "tomorrow"
// where the standard writes "in 1.004 days". Intl.ListFormat's formatToParts
// leaves an empty item out, joining the literals either side of it.
// Intl.DateTimeFormat makes a time style in a locale's -u-hc cycle even where
// hour12 overrode it, "02:12:47 PM" rather than "2:12:47 PM". Intl.Collator
// compares two strings from after the prefix they share, as ICU's does, so
// that with numeric Arabic-Indic 15 sorts after 100. And the host's zone, where
// nothing names it, is ICU's guess from the C library's abbreviations, or
// Etc/Unknown on Windows, where the standard takes the host's offset.
